# Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles that I've found useful. These define a prompt and a bunch of useful functions for my shell environment.

Some of it is written by me, some of it has been acquired from various sources on the Internet.

## Requirements

* Bash 4

This is mostly tested on Bash 4 running on OSX. It is intended to work in Bash 4 on any system.

## Getting started

1. Clone the directory
1. Run `linkDotFiles.sh`
1. Consider adding a bash file at `~/.local_env.sh` to load any variables, values or functions that you don't want to check in. For example if you store that in Dropbox: `ln -s ~/Dropbox/.local_env.sh ~/.local_env.sh`
1. Start a new shell
1. ???
1. Profit
